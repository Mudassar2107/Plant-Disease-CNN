# Plant Disease Classification using CNN

This minor college project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow to classify plant diseases from leaf images. The dataset was preprocessed with augmentation, and the model achieved high accuracy using Nadam optimizer.

## Features
- CNN architecture with 4 Conv layers
- Data augmentation: flipping and rotation
- TensorFlow + Keras
- 3-Class plant disease classification

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the Jupyter notebook: `Untitled.ipynb`
